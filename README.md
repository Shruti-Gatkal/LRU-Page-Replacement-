# LRU-Page-Replacement
In operating system page replacement is used for memory management, page replacement algorithms are needed to decide which page needed to be replaced when new page comes in.
Here, I implemented Least Recently Used Page replacement algorithm. Whenever a new page is referred and not present in memory, page fault occurs and Operating System replaces one of the existing pages with newly needed page. 
It is a greedy algorithm where the page to be replaced is least recently used. The idea is based on locality of reference, the least recently used page is not likely.  using C Language. I implemented this algorithm using C language.
